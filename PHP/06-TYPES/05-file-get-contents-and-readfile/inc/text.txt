PHP, short for Hypertext Preprocessor, is one of the most influential programming languages in the history of the web. For nearly three decades, it has powered a massive share of websites and applications, including some of the largest platforms in the world—such as WordPress, Facebook (in its early years), and Wikipedia. Despite being occasionally underestimated by newer developers or overshadowed by more recent technologies like Node.js, Python, or Go, PHP remains a cornerstone of web development. Its evolution from a simple templating tool to a powerful, object-oriented language with modern frameworks and robust performance demonstrates its ability to adapt to the changing demands of the internet.
